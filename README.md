## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello,

my name is Adam and I am a software craftsman.

<details>
<summary>A few kind words as an introduction (click to expand)</summary>

I say craftsman because I approach programming as a craftsmanship. While it is also true, that programming is an engineering discipline just as much as it is an art, craftsmanship is the most precise description. And as any other good craftsman I always seek an improvement in my doing. I keep my tools nice and sharp and am in constant search for better ones.

One of the most important tools in software craftsmanship is a programming language. As a matter of fact, just as important as human languages are important tools of communication in a society. And my "native" programming language is Python. It is almost the English of the programming world. There are situations better served by other languages, but it is a solid first choice. I have been building simple scripts, data processing applications and web services in Python and it served me well. My other skills include Linux, containers, Ansible, Git, CI/CD, bash scripting, and some others.

I would like to "kubernete" (did you know, what it means in old greek?) my software career into a more low-level direction. System programming and possibly embedded. That is why I am actively studying Rust and C. C needs no explanation. It may be true, that Rust is superseding C, but C will forever remain the Latin of programming - there are many excellent (even though sometimes ancient) texts written in it and it will remain this way for at least another few decades. Oh, and nobody will probably ever rewrite Donald Knuth's Art of Programming into another language. So it will always be handy to at least passively know C.

But, in my opinion, the single most influential language for another 50 years is and will be Rust. It is a very well-engineered language, which, unlike many others, has excellent ergonomics of usage. Generally an important parameter of any craftsman's tool. In other words, it is pleasant to write software with it. That is why I would like to work primarily in this language.

If you think I might be a good fit for your team, please, let me know. You can always write me an email at a.jelinek@pm.me or send me a message on LinkedIn. Or take a look at my [GitHub's profile](https://github.com/AdamJel), or my [GitHub page](https://adamjel.github.io/). I am looking forward to hearing from you.

### I work with

- Python: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/90)
- on Linux: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/75)
- with containers: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/70)
- alongside Ansible, Bash, and more

Psst...My guilty pleasure is Mikrotik hardware. I mean, you can SSH into them from your favourite terminal, they are super affordable and you can setup everything with them. Yes, even BGP in your home.

### I am currently learning

- Rust: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/40)
- Dart+Flutter: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/20)
- C (not++): ![](https://geps.dev/progress/10)

### I have my eyes on

- Go: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)
- Fortran: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0)
